# showme
Repo for my ShowMe project.

This software will allow you to rec and make a asciinema casts available to users on the command line.
It really just for me, but if others wants to use it you can.

I hope to make the install super easy and innovative.

Then:
----
- record casts
- find good place store files
- devel showme
-- test

### Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lordivxx/showme.git
